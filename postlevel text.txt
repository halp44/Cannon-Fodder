After beating Level 1:
---------------------
Rejoice, for the first of those filthy humans have fallen to our might! Let us move deeper into their territory with haste! Give them no quarter! This is the first of many cities that will be crushed beneath our heels! For Kijar! For Gakhoul!




After beating Level 2:
---------------------
Look at how they try to run away from us. So pathetic! Chase down the stragglers! Run through them to the next settlement and ensure no one makes it back alive! Their souls will make a fine gift for the great Gakhoul!




After beating Level 3:
---------------------
Surely this settlement wasn't the best they had. Those defenses fell apart with ease before our cannonballs! Raid the towns and burn their farms! Leave nothing left in this city for those disgusting humans to use.
