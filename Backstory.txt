The year is 1396.

The player controls the best artillery section within the entire Unholy Empire, nicknamed the Hammer of Destruction. Your crew has been directly blessed by the King of the empire. Following the spearhead invading force into the Kingdom of Anoma, this artillery section will be tasked with having to destroy the major defensive structures of every settlement the Unholy Empire besieges, such as the gate and towers, to make it easier for the invading force to move in. 

The Unholy Empire is an old empire that has been around since the year 650. Their empire is infamous for its egregious acts during war and their adamant worship of the God of Destruction, named Gakhoul. They act in His name for all of their actions with extreme zealotry. The vast majority of the Unholy Empire's soldiers are either undead or immortal, with the only humans present within the empire being commonfolk or slaves. The commonfolk partake in frenzious worship of Gakhoul. The King of the Unholy Empire is named Kijar The Ruthless, who calls himself the son and Herald of Gakhoul.

The Kingdom of Anoma is a passive kingdom founded on the prospect of freedom and justice. Its citizenry are mostly-peaceloving, with its military being an exception to the rule. Despite being passive, their military serves with honor and extremism for King Kalik. Unlike the Unholy Empire, their soldiers are human in purest form with most of them having an obsessive hatred over the undead.
